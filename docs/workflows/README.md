# Run workflow
lex-pr plan --from-github

## Customization Guide

Each workflow can be customized:

1. **Scope filters** - Which PRs to include
2. **Quality gates** - What checks to run
3. **Dependencies** - How PRs relate
4. **Automation level** - Manual vs automated

See [Autopilot Levels](../autopilot-levels.md) for automation options.
