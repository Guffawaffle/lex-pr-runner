# The Holy Grail: Recursive Self-Improving Merge-Weave Automation

**Epic**: Autopilot Levels & End-to-End Merge-Weave (pilot)
**Date Started**: 2025-10-02
**Objective**: Ship an automation ladder from report-only to full integration & finalization

---

## 🎯 The Vision: Recursive Self-Improvement

We are building a tool that improves itself through dogfooding. Each cycle:

1. **Use lex-pr-runner** to analyze and weave its own development PRs
2. **Identify gaps and friction** during the manual process
3. **Automate the manual steps** that caused friction
4. **Repeat the cycle** with improved tooling

**The Holy Grail**: A tool that can fully manage its own development lifecycle, from issue creation through merge-weave completion, while maintaining human oversight and safety.

## 📋 Epic A Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Foundation (Agents 1-2) - Critical Path
- **A1: Autopilot Levels Definition** (#78) - CLI flags, interfaces, validation
- **A2: Level 0 Implementation** (#79) - Analysis engine, reporting

### Phase 2: Safety & Artifacts (Agents 3-4) - Parallel
- **A4: Safety Framework** (#81) - TTY confirmation, kill switches, containment
- **A3: Level 1 Implementation** (#80) - Artifact generation, deliverables

### Phase 3: Integration (Agent 5) - Depends on All
- **A5: Level 2 Implementation** (#82) - PR annotations, status checks

## 🤖 Agent Deployment Log

### Agent 1: Foundation (#78)
**Status**: 🚀 ACTIVE
**Branch**: copilot/fix-2c2caf3b-3a85-4d36-97b7-f9580589b6fc
**PR**: #83 [WIP] A1: Define Autopilot Levels (0-4) and CLI Interface
**Scope**: Autopilot Levels Definition
**Started**: 2025-10-02 16:45 UTC

#### Acceptance Criteria Tracking:
- [ ] Define `AutopilotLevel` enum (0-4) with documentation
- [ ] Add CLI flags to Commander.js setup in `src/cli.ts`
- [ ] Create `AutopilotConfig` interface with flag mapping
- [ ] Add validation for level boundaries and flag combinations
- [ ] Unit tests for config parsing and validation
- [ ] Documentation: level definitions and flag usage

#### Key Dependencies:
- None (foundational work)

#### Estimated Completion:
- **Target**: 2-3 hours
- **Risk Level**: LOW (interface design only)

### Agent 4: Safety Framework (#81)
**Status**: 🚀 ACTIVE
**Branch**: copilot/fix-c5a2666b-[...]
**PR**: #84 [WIP] A4: Safety Framework - TTY Confirmation, Kill Switches & Containment
**Scope**: Safety mechanisms, TTY prompts, containment checks
**Started**: 2025-10-02 16:47 UTC

#### Acceptance Criteria Tracking:
- [ ] Create `SafetyFramework` class in `src/autopilot/safety/`
- [ ] Implement TTY confirmation with clear operation summaries
- [ ] Add advisory lock labels (e.g., `lex-pr:weaving`) on target PRs
- [ ] Implement containment checks (all PRs reachable, no external deps)
- [ ] Add kill switch detection (`--abort` flag, signal handling)
- [ ] Create rollback procedures for failed operations
- [ ] Unit tests for all safety mechanisms
- [ ] Integration test: safety stops prevent destructive operations

#### Key Dependencies:
- A1 interfaces (can work in parallel, merge conflicts expected and manageable)

#### Estimated Completion:
- **Target**: 3-4 hours
- **Risk Level**: LOW-MEDIUM (defensive programming)

## 🔄 Recursive Insights Captured

### From Previous Merge-Weave (PR-70 + PR-71):
1. **Manual execution is tedious** → Need automation levels
2. **Conflict prediction was 100% accurate** → Analysis engine is solid foundation
3. **Import unions worked perfectly** → Mechanical rules are implementable
4. **Documentation was crucial** → Artifact generation will be valuable
5. **Safety concerns emerged** → TTY confirmation and kill switches needed

### Expected Learning This Cycle:
- How well our level definitions match real workflow needs
- Which safety mechanisms are actually necessary vs paranoid
- Whether parallel agent development creates merge conflicts
- If our artifact generation reduces manual documentation burden

## 🎮 Meta-Recursive Checkpoints

### After Agent 1 Complete:
- ✅ CLI flags available for testing
- ✅ Foundation ready for Level 0 implementation
- 📝 Update this document with actual vs predicted outcomes

### After Agents 2-4 Complete:
- ✅ Level 0-1 functional and tested
- ✅ Safety framework protecting operations
- 🎯 **DOGFOOD OPPORTUNITY**: Use Level 1 to analyze merge of A1-A4
- 📝 Document how well automation reduces manual overhead

### After All Agents Complete:
- ✅ Full Level 0-2 autopilot implementation
- 🎯 **HOLY GRAIL TEST**: Use Level 2 to manage next development cycle
- 📝 Measure: Can the tool manage its own improvement cycle?

---

## 🧪 Success Criteria

### Quantitative:
- **Automation Coverage**: Level 0-2 implemented with full flag support
- **Safety Compliance**: No operations proceed without proper confirmation
- **Test Coverage**: All new code covered by unit and integration tests
- **Documentation**: Every level and flag documented with examples

### Qualitative:
- **Dogfooding Success**: Tool successfully analyzes its own development
- **Friction Reduction**: Manual steps identified and automated
- **Recursive Capability**: Tool can guide its next improvement cycle
- **Safety Confidence**: No fear of destructive operations

### Meta-Recursive:
- **Self-Improvement**: Tool identifies and addresses its own limitations
- **Emergent Capabilities**: Automation unlocks new workflow possibilities
- **Recursive Validation**: Each cycle validates and improves the previous

## 🚨 Critical Decision Points

### When to Stop and Merge-Weave:
- After foundational work (A1-A2) if agents encounter conflicts
- When 3+ branches are ready for integration
- If any agent work blocks others unexpectedly

### Safety Boundaries:
- No agent deploys without explicit human approval
- No destructive operations without TTY confirmation
- All automation must have manual override capabilities
- Kill switches must be tested and documented
