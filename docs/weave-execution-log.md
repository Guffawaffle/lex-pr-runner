# Merge-Weave Execution Log: PR-70 + PR-71

**Date**: 2025-10-01
**Branch**: `merge-weave`
**PRs**: #70 (Enforce write discipline) + #71 (Local overlay setup)
**Target**: main

---

## Pre-Execution Summary

### Plan Generation ‚úÖ
- **Command**: `npm run cli -- plan --from-github --query "is:open is:pr" --out .smartergpt/runner`
- **Result**: Successfully generated plan.json with 2 items
- **Schema**: v1.0.0
- **Target**: main
- **Policy**: requiredGates: [lint, typecheck, test], maxWorkers: 2

### Merge Order Computation ‚úÖ
- **Command**: `npm run cli -- merge-order --plan .smartergpt/runner/plan.json --json`
- **Result**: Single level `[["PR-70", "PR-71"]]`
- **Analysis**: PRs are independent (no dependencies)

### Conflict Analysis ‚úÖ
**File Overlap**:
- `src/cli.ts`: Import conflicts (mechanical weave)
- `src/mcp/server.ts`: Import conflicts + additive changes (mechanical weave)
- 9 other files: No overlap (trivial merge)

**Predicted Weave Distribution**:
- Trivial: 9 files
- Mechanical: 2 files
- Semantic: 0 files

**Risk Level**: LOW

## Issues Found & Fixed During Weave

### Issue #1: ESM Module Import Resolution
**Problem**: `PRQueryOptions` import failing in `src/github/client.ts`
**Root Cause**: Mixed type and value imports causing ESM resolution issues in Node.js v22
**Fix**: Separated `import type` for interfaces from value imports for classes
**Commit**: `86d7653` - "Fix: separate type and value imports in GitHub client"
**Status**: ‚úÖ RESOLVED

### Issue #2: Basic Merge Command Implementation
**Problem**: Current `merge` command is a placeholder (dry-run only shows plan)
**Analysis**: Doesn't actually execute git operations or detect real conflicts
**Impact**: Cannot test actual weave execution yet
**Status**: üîÑ IDENTIFIED (needs implementation)

### Issue #3: Runtime Artifacts in .gitignore
**Problem**: `.smartergpt/runner/` is git-ignored (by design)
**Analysis**: Follows two-track separation principle - runtime artifacts shouldn't be committed
**Resolution**: Create weave documentation in `docs/` instead
**Status**: ‚úÖ WORKING AS DESIGNED

## Next Steps

1. ‚è≥ Implement or enhance merge command to:
   - Actually checkout PR branches
   - Attempt git merge operations
   - Detect and classify conflicts
   - Apply weave contract rules

2. ‚è≥ Execute actual weave (not just dry-run)

3. ‚è≥ Run gates on woven result

4. ‚è≥ Create integration PR with proper reporting

## Findings & Improvement Opportunities

### Tool Gaps Identified

1. **Merge Execution Engine**: Need full implementation of weave contract
   - Trivial merge detection
   - Mechanical rule application (import unions, config merges)
   - Semantic patch generation
   - Conflict classification

2. **Conflict Resolution Tooling**: Automate mechanical rules
   - Import statement merging with deterministic sorting
   - Config file union operations
   - Dependency lockfile regeneration

3. **Gate Integration**: Run gates automatically during weave
   - After each merge attempt
   - Rollback on failure
   - Artifact collection

4. **Reporting**: Generate weave matrix automatically
   - Track which strategy was used per file
   - Record weave commit SHAs
   - Link to gate results

### Documentation Needs

1. ‚úÖ Add conflict analysis template
2. ‚úÖ Document ESM import patterns for future reference
3. ‚è≥ Create weave execution playbook
4. ‚è≥ Add troubleshooting guide for common weave failures
