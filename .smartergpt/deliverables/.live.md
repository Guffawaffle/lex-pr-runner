# CLI Command Implementation - Deliverables

## Executive Summary

Successfully implemented the CLI command `lex-pr plan` with the following enhancements:
- Added `--json` flag for CI integration that prints plan JSON to stdout
- Implemented robust error reporting with proper exit codes (0 for success, 1 for errors)
- Enhanced plan generation to read from `.smartergpt/stack.yml` and `.smartergpt/scope.yml` configuration files
- Added deterministic artifact generation (plan.json + snapshot.md) with consistent output
- Updated documentation and README with comprehensive usage examples

## Steps Taken

1. **Enhanced CLI Command Implementation**
   - Modified `src/cli.ts` to add `--json` flag support
   - Added comprehensive error handling with try-catch and proper exit codes
   - Implemented deterministic snapshot.md generation alongside plan.json

2. **Enhanced Plan Generation**
   - Updated `src/core/plan.ts` with YAML configuration file support
   - Added schemas for stack.yml and scope.yml validation using Zod
   - Implemented configuration file hierarchy (stack.yml > scope.yml > defaults)
   - Added proper error handling for invalid YAML and parsing errors

3. **Documentation Updates**
   - Completely rewrote README.md with comprehensive CLI usage examples
   - Added configuration file documentation with examples
   - Documented both TypeScript CLI and legacy Python CLI commands

## Final Results

### Acceptance Criteria Assessment: ✅ YES

- ✅ **Command writes artifacts and correct exit codes**: Success (exit 0), Error (exit 1)
- ✅ **`--json` prints valid JSON**: Outputs properly formatted JSON to stdout for CI
- ✅ **Deterministic artifacts**: Identical outputs for same inputs (no timestamps)

All acceptance criteria have been successfully met. The CLI command is fully functional, deterministic, and ready for production use.
