# Lex-PR Runner Doctor Checks Implementation

## Executive Summary

Successfully implemented the `lex-pr doctor` command to perform environment sanity checks as specified in the issue. The command now detects git presence, GitHub CLI presence, Node.js 20+, and write permissions to `.smartergpt/runner`, returning appropriate exit codes and clear guidance for fixing issues.

## Steps Taken

1. **Created `src/core/doctor.ts`** - Implemented comprehensive environment checks:
   - Git presence detection using `git --version`
   - GitHub CLI presence detection using `gh --version`
   - Node.js version check (>= 20.0.0) using `process.version`
   - Write permission check to `.smartergpt/runner` by creating/deleting test file

2. **Updated `src/cli.ts`** - Modified the doctor command:
   - Imported new `runDoctorChecks` function
   - Replaced TODO message with proper implementation
   - Added formatted output with ✓/✗ status indicators
   - Implemented proper exit codes (0 for success, 1 for failures)
   - Added clear fix guidance for failed checks

## Evidence & Verification

### Successful Health Check
```
Environment Health Check
======================
✓ Git: Git is installed and available
✓ GitHub CLI: GitHub CLI is installed and available
✓ Node.js Version: Node.js v20.19.5 is supported (>= 20.0.0)
✓ Write Permissions: Write permissions to .smartergpt/runner are available

✓ All checks passed! Environment is healthy.
Exit code: 0
```

### Failed Health Check (Simulated)
```
Environment Health Check
======================
✓ Git: Git is installed and available
✓ GitHub CLI: GitHub CLI is installed and available
✓ Node.js Version: Node.js v20.19.5 is supported (>= 20.0.0)
✗ Write Permissions: Cannot write to .smartergpt/runner: EACCES: permission denied, mkdir '.smartergpt/runner\
  Fix: Check directory permissions or run with appropriate privileges

✗ Some checks failed. Please address the issues above.
Exit code: 1
```

### Compilation Check
```
> npm run typecheck
✓ No TypeScript compilation errors
```

## Final Results

**Meets Acceptance Criteria: YES**

- ✅ `lex-pr doctor` returns 0 on healthy env
- ✅ Returns non-zero with clear guidance on failures
- ✅ Detects git present
- ✅ Detects gh present  
- ✅ Detects Node 20+
- ✅ Detects write perms to `.smartergpt/runner`
- ✅ Prints fixes and non-zero exit on fatal

## Files Changed

1. **`src/core/doctor.ts`** (new file) - Core doctor functionality
2. **`src/cli.ts`** - Updated doctor command implementation
