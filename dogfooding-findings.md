# Dogfooding Findings and Next Iteration Issues

Based on comprehensive E2E testing and dogfooding experience while implementing issues #57-79, the following improvements have been identified for the next iteration:

## High Priority Issues (Production Readiness)

### Issue #83: Enhanced CLI Error Reporting and User Experience
**Epic**: #76 (Developer Experience)
**Priority**: High
**Description**: Improve CLI error messages, output formatting, and user guidance based on E2E testing discoveries.

**Findings from E2E testing**:
- Profile resolution messages go to stderr but users expect them in stdout
- Error messages for write protection vary in format and clarity
- Some commands lack consistent `--json` output options
- Missing progress indicators for long-running operations

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Consistent error message formatting across all commands
- [ ] Profile resolution info should go to stderr with consistent format
- [ ] All commands support `--json` flag for machine-readable output
- [ ] Progress indicators for operations taking >2 seconds
- [ ] Help text includes common usage examples
- [ ] Exit codes documented and consistent (0=success, 1=error, 2=validation)

### Issue #84: Autopilot Deliverables Management
**Epic**: #74 (Autopilot Levels)
**Priority**: High
**Description**: Improve autopilot deliverables directory management and artifact organization.

**Findings from E2E testing**:
- Timestamped directories make artifacts hard to find programmatically
- No cleanup mechanism for old deliverables
- Missing artifact indexing for CI/CD integration
- Deliverables not linked to original plan/execution context

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Optional `--deliverables-dir` override for predictable paths
- [ ] Symlink to `latest/` directory for most recent artifacts
- [ ] Cleanup command to manage deliverables history
- [ ] Artifact manifest with plan hash and execution metadata
- [ ] Integration guide for CI/CD systems

### Issue #85: Gate Report Schema Evolution and Validation
**Epic**: #75 (Schema Management)
**Priority**: High
**Description**: Enhance gate report validation and provide migration path for schema changes.

**Findings from E2E testing**:
- Gate report schema requires `started_at` but errors are unclear
- No validation of gate result files before aggregation
- Missing migration support for gate report format changes
- Report aggregation lacks configuration options

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] `lex-pr-runner gate-report validate <file>` command
- [ ] Clear validation error messages with fix suggestions
- [ ] Schema migration utilities for gate report formats
- [ ] Configurable report aggregation (filtering, sorting, grouping)
- [ ] Example gate report templates in documentation

## Medium Priority Issues (Developer Experience)

### Issue #86: Enhanced Configuration Management
**Epic**: #76 (Developer Experience)
**Priority**: Medium
**Description**: Improve profile and configuration management based on user workflow patterns.

**Findings from dogfooding**:
- Profile precedence chain is powerful but hard to debug
- Missing configuration validation at startup
- No easy way to override individual config values
- Profile roles could be more granular

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] `lex-pr-runner config show` command with precedence visualization
- [ ] `lex-pr-runner config validate` for configuration health checks
- [ ] Environment variable overrides for all config values
- [ ] Profile inheritance/composition system
- [ ] Configuration diff/merge utilities

### Issue #87: Test Infrastructure Improvements
**Epic**: #75 (Schema Management)
**Priority**: Medium
**Description**: Enhance test infrastructure based on E2E testing experience.

**Findings from E2E implementation**:
- Test fixtures need better organization and reusability
- Missing performance benchmarking infrastructure
- E2E tests could benefit from parallel execution
- Test isolation improvements needed for CI reliability

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Shared test fixture library with realistic scenarios
- [ ] Performance regression test suite
- [ ] Parallel E2E test execution with proper isolation
- [ ] Test report aggregation and trending
- [ ] Mock GitHub API server for deterministic integration tests

## Low Priority Issues (Nice to Have)

### Issue #88: Plan Generation and Validation Enhancements
**Epic**: #75 (Schema Management)
**Priority**: Low
**Description**: Improve plan generation workflows and validation feedback.

**Findings from dogfooding**:
- Plan generation from GitHub could be more intelligent
- Dependency analysis could suggest optimizations
- Missing plan diff/comparison utilities
- No plan templates for common patterns

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Smart dependency inference from file changes
- [ ] Plan optimization suggestions (parallelization opportunities)
- [ ] `lex-pr-runner plan diff` for comparing plans
- [ ] Plan template library with best practices
- [ ] Interactive plan builder/editor

### Issue #89: Integration and Ecosystem Support
**Epic**: #77 (Integration Patterns)
**Priority**: Low
**Description**: Expand integration capabilities based on real-world usage patterns.

**Findings from dogfooding**:
- CI/CD integration patterns need documentation
- Missing webhooks/notifications for long-running operations
- Could integrate better with existing PR management tools
- Monitoring and observability gaps for production use

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] CI/CD integration cookbook with examples
- [ ] Webhook support for operation lifecycle events
- [ ] GitHub App for enhanced PR integration
- [ ] Metrics export for monitoring systems (Prometheus, etc.)
- [ ] Integration with common notification systems (Slack, Discord, etc.)

## Technical Debt and Architecture

### Issue #90: Code Organization and Module Boundaries
**Epic**: #76 (Developer Experience)
**Priority**: Medium
**Description**: Refactor code organization based on feature growth and boundary clarity.

**Findings from development**:
- CLI command organization could be clearer
- Core logic mixed with CLI presentation in some areas
- Missing plugin/extension architecture for custom gates
- Type definitions could be more granular

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Clear separation between core logic and CLI presentation
- [ ] Plugin system for custom gate implementations
- [ ] Modular command structure (subcommands as separate modules)
- [ ] Comprehensive TypeScript type definitions export
- [ ] API documentation for programmatic usage

## Summary

This dogfooding iteration revealed that the core functionality is solid, but production readiness requires:
1. **Better error handling and user experience** (#83)
2. **Improved artifact management** (#84)
3. **Enhanced validation and migration support** (#85)

The comprehensive E2E test suite proved invaluable for discovering interface mismatches and ensuring the "Holy Grail" merge pyramid approach works reliably across complex scenarios.

**Recommended next sprint focus**: Issues #83-85 for production readiness, with #86-87 following for developer experience improvements.
